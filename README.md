# Changes - 09/2022
* Enabled Captcha for contact form
* Imported EmailJS to work with contact form to kick form to my professional email
* Implemented VanillaToast to produce success and failure toasts (because I loathe alert boxes with a passion ðŸ˜¡) for the contact form 
    * will likely change the layout for this feature
* Added Miro board to skills since I used to use it to track dependencies and tickets

# Todos
* will need to update an internal scrolling for projects and a link for a personal project
* ðŸ¤¯ need to make another website for non-professional dev work - Raspberry Pi, SteamDeck UI enhancements, Scripting, and public API work
